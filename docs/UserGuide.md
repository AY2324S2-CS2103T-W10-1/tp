### Adding a client: `add`

The 'add' command serves as your gateway to inputting client details effortlessly, offering an extensive array of fields to capture comprehensive information. From essential contact details to optional remarks, `Realodex` empowers you to create a rich repository of client information, ensuring you have everything you need at your fingertips to cultivate meaningful relationships with your clients.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° Prefixes are also not case sensitive, For example, `t/` and `T/`  are the same.

both, so tags only accept ‚Äúbuyer‚Äù or ‚Äúseller‚Äù as the input
(case-insensitive).

### Deleting a client :
`delete`

Deletes the specified client from Realodex. There are 2 ways to do
so:

### Deleting by name

Format: `delete n/NAME`

- Deletes the client of the specified `NAME` in
  Realodex.
- If name is **not found**, error message will be shown
  `"NAME" is not found`.

Example: * `delete n/Udhaya Shanmugam` deletes the client
in Realodex with the name ‚ÄúUdhaya Shanmugam‚Äù.

### Deleting by index

Format: `delete INDEX`

- Deletes the client of the specified `INDEX` in
  Realodex.
- If the index number is **invalid**, error message will
  be shown `The client index provided is invalid`.

Example: * `delete 4` deletes the 4th client listed in
Realodex, provided he/she exists.

### Editing clients : `edit`

Edits specified details of the client.

Format:
`edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [i/INCOME] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [f/FAMILY] [t/TAG] [r/REMARK]`

- If `INDEX` is `3`, the 3rd client‚Äôs
  information will be edited.
- It is optional to edit any field (i.e, you can choose to edit any
  combination of fields so long there is at least 1).
- The current information will be overwritten with the input
  provided.

Examples:

- `edit 1 p/999` will overwrite the 1st client‚Äôs phone
  number to `999`.
- `edit 2 n/Kylie i/3333 f/5` will overwrite the 2nd
  client‚Äôs name to `Kylie`, income to `3333` and
  family size to `5`.

### Filtering clients :
`filter`

Filters the list of client with an input keyphrase.

Format: `filter KEYPHRASE`

- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `james` will match
  `James`
- Partial words will still be matched e.g.¬†`Udh` will match
  `Udhaya`
- All persons‚Äô names containing the keyword will be returned
  e.g.¬†`Al` will return `Alicia`,
  `Allysa`

Example:

- `filter Al` will list out persons whose name has
  `"Al"` inside, such as `"Alicia"`,
  `"Allysa"` and `"Jamal"`

### Listing clients : `list`

Lists all clients in Realodex.

Format: `list`

### Help : `help`

Generates a pop-up window which is a summarised version of the User
Guide.

Format: `help`

### Exiting the program :
`exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

Realodex data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any
command that modifies it. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Realodex data is saved automatically as a JSON file
`[JAR file location]/data/realodex.json`. Advanced users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Caution:** If your changes to the data file makes its
format invalid, Realodex will discard all data and start with an empty
data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of
the file before editing it.

Furthermore, certain edits can cause the
Realodex to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is
outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you
are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Filtering
clients by income and more `[coming in v1.3]`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another
Computer?

**A**: Install the app in the other computer
and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the
   application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the
   primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete
   the `preferences.json` file created by the application before
   running the application again.
